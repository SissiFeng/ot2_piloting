# Data Processing and Lineage Implementation

## Architecture Overview

### Current Implementation (On-Premise)
We implemented a hybrid approach combining real-time processing with batch processing capabilities:

1. **Real-time Data Pipeline**
```python
# MQTT Client for real-time data collection
class OT2MQTTClient:
    async def on_message(self, client, userdata, msg):
        # Real-time processing within 1 minute
        payload = json.loads(msg.payload.decode())
        await self.process_data(payload)
```

2. **ETL Pipeline**
```python
class DataPipeline:
    @task(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=1)
    async def extract_data(self, experiment_id: UUID):
        # Fast data extraction
        pass

    @task
    async def transform_data(self, data: Dict[str, Any]):
        # Parallel processing
        pass

    @task
    async def load_data(self, transformed_data: Dict[str, Any]):
        # Efficient data loading
        pass
```

3. **Data Lineage Tracking**
```python
class DataLineage:
    source_id: UUID
    target_id: UUID
    relationship_type: DataLineageType
    transformation_id: Optional[UUID]
    created_at: datetime
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Parallel Processing
- Using asyncio for concurrent operations
- Batch processing for multiple experiments
- Prefect for workflow orchestration

### 2. Caching Strategy
```python
class CacheConfig:
    enabled: bool = True
    ttl_seconds: int = 3600
    max_size_mb: int = 1000
    eviction_policy: str = "lru"
```

### 3. Database Optimization
- Dual-write architecture
- Indexed fields for quick lookups
- Materialized views for common queries

## Time Window Analysis

### Processing Steps and Timing
1. Data Collection: ~1 minute
   - MQTT message reception
   - Initial validation

2. Data Processing: ~2 minutes
   - Transformation
   - Quality checks
   - Feature extraction

3. Data Storage: ~1 minute
   - Database writes
   - Lineage recording

4. Data Verification: ~1 minute
   - Consistency checks
   - Lineage verification

Total Processing Time: < 5 minutes

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Performance Metrics
```python
# Prometheus metrics
PROCESSING_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'data_processing_latency_seconds',
    'Time taken for data processing'
)

LINEAGE_TRACKING_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'lineage_tracking_latency_seconds',
    'Time taken for lineage tracking'
)
```

### Alerts
```yaml
# Prometheus alert rules
groups:
  - name: data_processing
    rules:
      - alert: ProcessingTimeExceeded
        expr: data_processing_latency_seconds > 300
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: warning
```

## Cloud Migration Path

### Future Cloud Implementation Options

1. **AWS Implementation**
```yaml
# AWS Architecture
services:
  - AWS Lambda for data processing
  - Amazon MSK for MQTT
  - Amazon Neptune for lineage
  - Amazon TimeStream for time-series
```

2. **Azure Implementation**
```yaml
# Azure Architecture
services:
  - Azure Functions for processing
  - Event Hub for MQTT
  - Cosmos DB for storage
  - Azure Data Factory for ETL
```

3. **GCP Implementation**
```yaml
# GCP Architecture
services:
  - Cloud Functions for processing
  - Cloud Pub/Sub for MQTT
  - Cloud Spanner for storage
  - Cloud Dataflow for ETL
```

## Comparison: On-Premise vs Cloud

### Current On-Premise Solution
✅ Advantages:
- Complete control over infrastructure
- Lower latency for local operations
- No data egress costs
- Simpler compliance for data locality

⚠️ Challenges:
- Manual scaling
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Limited processing power
- Higher upfront costs

### Future Cloud Solution
✅ Advantages:
- Automatic scaling
- Serverless processing
- Managed services
- Pay-per-use pricing

⚠️ Considerations:
- Data transfer costs
- Cloud vendor lock-in
- Network latency
- Compliance requirements
